# ML-training---spanish

These notebooks are supposed to be used as presentations together with RISE extension (https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to Jupyter. 

Although the training is still under development, the expected content would be:

Part 1 - Introduction (appendix for environment installation)
Part 2 - Datasets - Definition, Data Visualization, Preprocessing
Part 3 - Supervised Learning (featuring Linear Regression and Logistic Regression), Model evaluation
Part 4 - Supervised Learning (SVMs), Kernel trick
Part 5 - Supervised Learning (KNN), Hyperparameter Optimization
Part 6 - Supervised Learning (Decision Trees), Handling Underfitting/Overfitting
Part 7 - Supervised Learning (Random Forests), Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting)
Part 8 - Supervised Learning (Neural Network), Deep Learning, Representation learning, Optimization (SGD, momentum, learning rate, etc)
Part 9 - Supervised Learning (Convolutional Neural Network), Batch Normalization, Dropout, Skip connections
Part 10 - Unsupervised Learning (Kmeans), Clustering, Anomaly detection
Part 11 - Unsupervised Learning (Autoencoders), Generative networks
Part 12 - RNN, LTSM?
Part 13 -
