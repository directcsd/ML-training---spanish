# ML-training---spanish

These notebooks are supposed to be used as presentations together with RISE extension (https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to Jupyter. 

Although the training is still under development, the expected content would be:

1. Introduction (appendix for environment installation)
1. Datasets - Definition, Data Visualization, Preprocessing
1. Supervised Learning (featuring Linear Regression and Logistic Regression), Model evaluation
1. Supervised Learning (SVMs), Kernel trick
1. Supervised Learning (KNN), Hyperparameter Optimization
1. Supervised Learning (Decision Trees), Handling Underfitting/Overfitting
1. Supervised Learning (Random Forests), Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
1. Supervised Learning (Neural Network), Deep Learning, Optimization (SGD, momentum, learning rate, etc)
1. Supervised Learning (Convolutional Neural Network), Batch Normalization, Dropout, Skip connections, Transfer learning
1. Unsupervised Learning (Kmeans), Clustering, Anomaly detection
1. Unsupervised Learning (Autoencoders), Representation learning, Generative networks
1. RNN, LTSM, Embedding???
1. Reinforcement Learning???
1. Bayesian Deep Learning???
